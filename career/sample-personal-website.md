## About Me
Assalamualaikum, I'm Ahmed Khan, a computer science graduate from the Foundation for Advancement of Science and Technology (FAST), Pakistan. I'm a full stack developer specializing in JavaScript, particularly ReactJS and NodeJS, and I have a keen interest in machine learning. I'm currently a Beta Fellowship research fellow, working on the application of machine learning in web development.

During my time at FAST, I've worked on several projects, ranging from developing full stack applications to exploring machine learning algorithms. More details can be found in my CV.

In my free time, I enjoy reading about Islamic history, writing poetry, and exploring the world of tech startups.
