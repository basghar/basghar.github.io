**3. Ensuring Software Quality:**

Companies that prioritize the quality of their software employ several strategies to make sure their product works as expected and delivers an excellent user experience. High-quality software doesn't happen by accident. It's a result of rigorous, well-implemented practices that encompass the entire development process. Here are some of the strategies that companies employ to ensure software quality:

* **Automated testing**: Automated tests run a suite of pre-scripted tests to ensure code correctness. It ranges from unit testing (verifying individual components), through integration testing (testing component interactions), to end-to-end (e2e) testing (validating the system works together as a whole). 
    
    [Introduction to Automated Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZDTi7hjhJ4) [Youtube]

* **Unit Testing**: This type of testing involves examining individual components of a program separately to ensure they function correctly. These tests are typically written and maintained by developers themselves and are automated to run whenever changes are made. They help catch bugs early in the development process and facilitate the addition of new features or refactoring of existing code.

* **Integration Testing**: This goes a step beyond unit testing and tests how the individual units of a program work together. This ensures that the system as a whole functions correctly and can catch issues that may not be evident when units are tested individually. 
  
   [Integration Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNIttd87xs) [Youtube]

* **End-to-end (e2e) testing**: End-to-end (e2e) testing is a methodology used to verify whether a system works as intended from start to finish, from the point of user interaction to the database or server and back. In essence, it simulates real user scenarios to ensure all interconnected components of an application work harmoniously together. 

    For instance, in a shopping app, an end-to-end test might involve logging in, searching for a product, adding it to the cart, checking out, and verifying that the order shows correctly in the user's order history.
