title: A Guide for aspiring and fresh IT graduates, building a robust professional profile
---

Whether you're about to embark on your undergraduate journey in IT or you've recently graduated, this guide is designed to help you build a robust professional profile. If you didn't start these steps at the beginning of your degree, it's never too late to start now.

## 1. Establish your online presence: LinkedIn and personal website
Whether you're a freshman or a recent graduate, it's crucial to create your LinkedIn profile and personal website. These platforms will serve as your digital portfolio, showcasing your skills, projects, and achievements. Keep them updated throughout your degree and beyond. 

Refer to this [Sample Personal Website](./sample-personal-website.md) for inspiration.

## 2. Leverage your degree assignments
Every assignment during your degree is a potential addition to your professional portfolio. Ensure your work is thorough, well-documented, and effectively demonstrates your skills. If you didn't check your assignments into GitHub during your degree, start doing it now. As you acquire new skills, refine and improve your earlier work.

## 3. Showcase your work
Your degree is an important credential, but employers value demonstrable work. Focus on creating work that you can publicly display. This includes projects, assignments, and any other work that you're proud of. If possible, deploy your projects so that people can see your actual work, not just the code. Add descriptions to all your projects, presentations, talks, accomplishments, and publications. Include links to actual publications, uploaded presentations, GitHub for source code, and hosted demos.

## 4. Proactively expand your knowledge
University coursework may not always align with industry requirements. Be proactive in learning about areas that may not be covered in your degree but are relevant to your field. For example, learn about continuous integration and deployment to maintain your personal website. Tools like GitHub Actions can automatically deploy changes to your website, enhancing your skill set and demonstrating your initiative. Consider taking additional courses from platforms like [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend), [Interns.pk](https://interns.pk/), or [Knowledge Tech](http://www.knowledge.tech). Remember, it's not just the course certificate that's important, but the work you do during the course and how it adds demonstrable work to your profile.

## 5. Seek recommendations
Whether you're still studying or have recently graduated, if a professor appreciates your work, ask for a recommendation. These testimonials can add significant weight to your profile, vouching for your skills, work ethic, and ability to deliver quality work.

## 6. Learn effective teamwork
The ability to work effectively in a team is crucial. Learn to listen to others, handle disagreements calmly, and not let ego hinder your learning. Learn to distribute work among team members and delegate tasks by establishing trust. Learn to diffuse negativity among team members.

## 7. Maintain a positive attitude and humility
Maintain a positive attitude towards everyone, even if they're struggling with their studies. If you happen to be one of the top performers, never show off or let others feel discouraged. Remember, if you're able to excel, it's not solely due to your own qualities, but a blessing and ability bestowed upon you by Allah. Teaching is a great way to learn and expand your knowledge. Always use an encouraging and positive tone, and strive to uplift those around you. This not only fosters a supportive learning environment, but also reflects your character and humility.

## 8. Stay proactive and motivated
Many students struggle with maximizing their learning time during their degree. Learn to be proactive and keep yourself motivated. Starting a project that you're passionate about can be a great way to stay motivated and learning new skills. 

## 9. Network and engage
LinkedIn is not just a platform for showcasing your skills; it's also a powerful networking tool. Connect with classmates, professors, and professionals in your field. Engage with posts, share your own insights, and participate in discussions. Networking can open up opportunities for internships, collaborations, and jobs.

## 10. Embrace lifelong learning
The tech industry is constantly evolving. Stay relevant by continuously learning and improving your skills. This could mean learning new programming languages, frameworks, or concepts, or improving your soft skills, such as communication and problem-solving.

## 11. Start small, think big, and embrace agile
While it's often said to think big, it's equally important to start with smaller, achievable targets. This approach aligns with the agile methodology, which emphasizes incremental progress and continuous improvement. Setting and achieving smaller goals not only keeps you motivated but also provides a sense of accomplishment that fuels your drive to continue working. Ideally, no goal should span more than a couple of days.

Choose projects that have practical applications, either for yourself or for others. Developing a tool or application that you or someone else can actually use, provides a valuable feedback loop. This feedback can be a great source of encouragement and can help you refine and improve your work. Remember, every big achievement starts with a small step. By setting small, achievable goals, you're laying the foundation for bigger successes in the future.

> Remember, your professional profile is a reflection of your journey, your passion, and your commitment to learning and growth. Whether you're just starting your degree or have recently graduated, it's never too late to start building a robust professional profile. Keep it updated, and it will serve as a powerful tool in your career development.
