title: The advantages of remote software jobs for pakistani graduates
---

In the modern age, the software industry is not confined to geographical limits. Remote work has expanded opportunities for Pakistani software graduates, offering countless benefits. This trend also benefits organizations, allowing them to source talent globally, diversify their workforce, and potentially reduce costs. Like everything it has certain disadvantages as well but despite the challenges, more and more companies are exploring the potential of a remote workforce. Let's delve into the benefits of these opportunities for software engineers.

## Advantages of working remotely for global companies

1. ### Gaining proficiency in software development practices
International companies often prioritize software development practices more extensively than many local companies in the Pakistani software industry, overlooking the long-term benefits primarily due to initial cost considerations. This exposure to methodologies like Agile, DevOps, continuous integration/deployment, and test-driven development equips Pakistani graduates with competitive skills sought after in the global job market.

1. ### Significant financial benefits
Receiving payment in a robust foreign currency, such as the USD or EUR, proves highly advantageous due to the continuous depreciation of the local currency. While an hourly wage of 15~20 USD may be considered lower-end globally, it translates into a substantial monthly income when compared to local Pakistani salaries. For instance, an hourly wage of USD 15/hr roughly converts to 600,000 PKR per month. Despite the ongoing economic challenges and political instability in Pakistan, there is a noticeable trend towards migration. However, it's crucial to consider the relatively high cost of living in many preferred migration destinations, which can potentially impact the savings ratio. Despite the increasing inflation in Pakistan, international remittances offer lucrative earnings that can still maintain a highly advantageous earning-to-saving ratio, with seasoned professionals earning up to USD 50/hr, equivalent to approximately 2,000,000 PKR per month.

1. ### Tax relief
Pakistani legislation provides tax relief for contractors working for foreign firms. This provision allows software professionals to save significantly on taxes, making their earnings even more lucrative. While these laws are subject to political changes, most governments lean towards promoting exports, resulting in a maximum tax rate of 1 percent so far.

1. ### Exposure to diverse work cultures
International companies provides exposure to different work cultures, allowing Pakistani graduates to broaden their perspectives and gain valuable cross-cultural skills.

1. ### Global connections & varied project experiences 
Working for international companies offers valuable networking opportunities and a wide range of project experiences, fostering significant professional growth.

1. ### Improved work-life balance & increased productivity 
Remote work provides the flexibility that fosters an improved work-life balance and has the potential to boost productivity. However, achieving these benefits necessitates self-discipline.

1. ### Flexible relocation opportunities: 
Remote work offers the freedom to easily relocate, allowing software professionals to explore diverse locations. This flexibility enables individuals to enjoy travel while working and even embrace a nomadic lifestyle. 

## Challenges of securing a remote role
However, it's not all smooth sailing. Local graduates often face hurdles in meeting the stringent requirements of remote roles. Remote opportunities typically favor seasoned software developers who not only hold domain expertise, but also have experience in contemporary software practices.

### Gap in education and industry demands
A significant challenge lies in the gap between the university curriculum and modern technologies and industry trends. This discrepancy often leaves local software companies investing considerable resources to train fresh graduates, a challenge that becomes even more significant for international firms. 

### Local industry limitations
The software industry in Pakistan, while growing, is relatively small. Many local companies do not recognize the value in implementing modern practices such as continuous integration/deployment, and automated testing. Consequently, local software developers may lack opportunities to gain practical experience in these areas. 

## Developing competencies for remote roles
Local software developers can adopt certain strategies to augment their skills and increase their attractiveness to companies recruiting for remote positions:
1.  ### Emphasizing quality and best practices 
To stand out as a candidate for remote roles, it is important to go beyond technical knowledge. Demonstrating a strong commitment to quality and adherence to industry best practices within your domain can set you apart from other candidates. These qualities reflect professionalism and dedication, which are highly valued in remote work environments where independent decision-making and a proactive approach are essential. By embodying these attributes, you can enhance your prospects in the global remote job market.

    - Familiarize yourself with Test-Driven Development (TDD), Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), and Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD) techniques.
    - Learn and embrace automation in unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
    - Incorporate peer code reviews into your workflows, such as leveraging Github's pull requests.

1. ### Building relevant skills
Identify the additional specific skills or experiences, beyond core capabilities, that are often required by businesses offering remote jobs. Some of these skills include:

    - Proficiency in **Agile methodologies** like Scrum and Kanban.
    - In the realm of Agile, familiarity with **automated software builds**, integration of automated test & quality tools in this automation, and **continuous integration**.
    - Experience in **DevOps**.
    - Related to DevOps, understanding of **infrastructure as code** & **continuous deployment**.
    - Knowledge of containers and their utilization in creating consistent and **reproducible development environments**.
    - **Self-motivation and discipline**: The ability to stay motivated and disciplined without the physical oversight of a manager is key. You need to be able to manage your own workload and meet deadlines without external prompting.
    - **Communication**: With no in-person interactions, clear and concise written and verbal communication skills are essential. You must be able to effectively express your thoughts and ideas through emails, chat messages, video calls, etc.
    - **Time management**: Remote work often requires balancing work tasks with home life, making time management crucial. It's important to be able to prioritize tasks and manage your time efficiently.
    - **Adaptability**: Remote work environments can change rapidly, and technology can sometimes be unpredictable. Being able to adapt quickly to new tools, systems, or working methods is a valuable skill.
    - **Empathy and emotional intelligence**: Understanding and respecting the feelings of others, especially when communication is predominantly virtual, can help maintain positive team dynamics. It's important to read between the lines and understand the emotional context behind messages.
    - **Proactiveness**: In a remote work environment, it's important to be proactive, whether it's about taking on tasks or seeking help. Waiting for instructions might lead to delays and misunderstandings.
    - **Resilience**: The ability to stay motivated in the face of challenges, stress, or uncertainty is particularly important in a remote working context.
    - **Trustworthiness**: Since remote work often involves less supervision, being reliable and trustworthy is essential. Employers need to trust that you're completing your work even if they can't see you.
