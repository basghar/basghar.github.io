One approach to addressing the shortage of skilled IT workers is to provide training to recent graduates in engineering disciplines such as mechanical, electrical, and mechatronics. These fields require strong problem-solving skills and mathematical aptitude, which can be beneficial for algorithmic thinking in IT roles. By providing additional training in computer science and programming languages, these graduates can become suitable candidates for IT industry and programming jobs.

### Screening engineering grads

Filtering and identifying fresh engineering graduates who are suitable for the IT industry and programming jobs involves looking for certain skills and qualities in their resumes, designing appropriate tests, and asking pertinent questions during interviews. Here are some suggestions:

### Resume Screening:

1. **Ability to solve problems:** Engineering fields such as mechanical, electrical, and mechatronics demand strong problem-solving abilities. Look for instances where they have demonstrated this skill through projects or experiences.  
[Examples of such projects](mechanical/example-projects)

1. **Aptitude for mathematics:** Engineers typically possess strong mathematical abilities, which can aid in algorithmic thinking for IT positions.

1. **Proficiency in computers / Familiarity with programming :** Even basic knowledge of computer science and programming languages, whether self-taught or acquired through elective courses, can be a positive indicator. Look for any relevant experience with programming, such as through school projects, internships or hackathons.

1. **Desire to learn new skills:** Enrolling in extra classes, online training, or earning certifications beyond one's primary degree program shows initiative and a strong interest in developing new abilities, particularly in the fields of IT or coding. Business and management, general communication, and statistics are examples of additional courses besides IT courses. In reality, any extra course demonstrates a willingness to acquire new knowledge.

1. **Interpersonal and communication skills:** Involvement in team-based projects, leadership roles in student organizations, and strong writing skills can indicate this.

### Designing Tests:

1. **Problem-solving tests:** Engineers might not have formal training in programming but they are often adept problem solvers. Give them logical or algorithmic problems to solve.

2. **Basic programming tests:** If they have some programming knowledge, you could give them simple coding tasks in a language they are comfortable with. 

3. **Aptitude tests:** You could test their logic, analytical abilities, and basic mathematical skills, all of which are essential for programming.

4. **Project-based tests:** Assign a small project related to the job they are applying for. This could involve designing a simple system or creating a basic application.

### Interview Questions:

1. **Interest in IT:** Why are you interested in transitioning from engineering to IT? 

2. **Learning agility:** How do you approach learning a new skill, especially in an area where you might not have formal education? 

3. **Problem-solving:** Can you describe a situation where you had to solve a complex problem, and explain your thought process?

4. **Programming knowledge:** What programming languages, if any, are you familiar with? Describe a project where you used these skills.

5. **Teamwork and communication:** How have you handled working in a team, especially when disagreements arise?

> Remember, these graduates might not have all the formal IT skills yet, but their engineering background, problem-solving skills, and willingness to learn could make them a valuable asset in the long term. The training you provide will help them transition smoothly into their new IT roles.
