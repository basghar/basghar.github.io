title: Identifying potential software development professionals with engineering backgrounds
---

One approach to addressing the shortage of skilled IT workers is to provide training to recent graduates in engineering disciplines such as mechanical, electrical, and mechatronics. These fields require strong problem-solving skills and mathematical aptitude, which can be beneficial for algorithmic thinking in IT roles. By providing additional training in computer science and programming languages, these graduates can become suitable candidates for IT industry and programming jobs.

## Screening engineering grads

Filtering and identifying fresh engineering graduates who are suitable for the IT industry and programming jobs involves looking for certain skills and qualities in their resumes, designing appropriate tests, and asking pertinent questions during interviews. Here are some suggestions:

### Resume Screening:

1. **Ability to solve problems:** Engineering fields such as mechanical, electrical, and mechatronics demand strong problem-solving abilities. Look for instances where they have demonstrated this skill through projects or experiences.  
[Examples of such projects](mechanical/example-projects)

1. **Aptitude for mathematics:** Engineers typically possess strong mathematical abilities, which can aid in algorithmic thinking for IT positions.

1. **Desire to learn new skills:** Enrolling in extra classes, online training, or earning certifications beyond one's primary degree program shows initiative and a strong interest in developing new abilities, particularly in the fields of IT or coding. Business and management, general communication, and statistics are examples of additional courses besides IT courses. In reality, any extra course demonstrates a willingness to acquire new knowledge.

1. **Interpersonal and communication skills:** Involvement in team-based projects, leadership roles in student organizations, and strong writing skills can indicate this.

### Designing Tests:

1. **Problem-solving tests:** Engineers might not have formal training in programming but they are often adept problem solvers. Give them logical or algorithmic problems to solve.

2. **Basic programming tests:** If they have some programming knowledge, you could give them simple coding tasks in a language they are comfortable with. 

3. **Aptitude tests:** You could test their logic, analytical abilities, and basic mathematical skills, all of which are essential for programming.

4. **Project-based tests:** Assign a small project related to the job they are applying for. This could involve designing a simple system or creating a basic application.

### Interview Questions:
When interviewing candidates, it's crucial to prepare questions that would not only gauge their interest in IT and software development but also assess their agility to learn, problem-solving abilities, knowledge in programming, and their ability in teamwork and communication.

Here are some example questions categorized under these five important themes. These can serve as a template, and you are encouraged to modify them to suit your specific organizational needs and the particularities of the role you're hiring for.

1. **Interest in IT:**
   - Can you tell us about a time when your interest in IT or software development was sparked?
   - How do you see your previous engineering training benefiting you in the software development field?
   - What areas of IT or software development do you find most appealing and why?
   - How do you keep up-to-date with the latest IT trends and technologies?
   - Do you have any personal projects or achievements related to software development you'd like to share?

2. **Learning agility:**
   - Can you describe a new skill or technology that you had to learn quickly in your previous job? How did you go about it?
   - Tell us about a time when you had to self-learn a new concept or technology. How did you ensure you understood it?
   - What are your strategies when it comes to learning new software or programming languages?
   - How do you handle a situation when you are required to work on a project involving technologies you are not familiar with?
   - What is the most challenging skill you have learned recently and why?

3. **Problem-solving:**
   - Can you discuss a time when you had to troubleshoot a complex electrical/mechanical issue? How do you see these skills translating to software development?
   - Tell us about a time when you had to debug a piece of code or software. What was the process?
   - How would you approach a situation where a piece of software isn't working as expected?
   - Can you share an example of a time when you faced a problem you couldnâ€™t solve immediately and how you managed it?
   - What steps do you generally follow to solve a problem?

4. **Programming knowledge:**
   - Which programming languages do you feel most comfortable using and why?
   - Can you give an example of a software project where you used your knowledge of a particular programming language?
   - How have your engineering skills informed or impacted your approach to coding?
   - Describe a situation where you had to learn a new programming language for a project. How did you find it?
   - What was the most complex coding problem you have solved so far? Can you explain how you did it?

5. **Teamwork and communication:**
   - Describe a time when you were working on a project with a team and a disagreement arose. How did you handle it?
   - Can you share an experience where effective communication played a crucial role in the success of an IT project?
   - How do you communicate technical issues to non-technical colleagues or clients?
   - Have you ever had to present or explain a complex IT problem or solution to a group of non-IT people? How did you go about it?
   - What role do you usually take on in a team setting and why?


> Remember, these graduates might not have all the formal IT skills yet, but their engineering background, problem-solving skills, and willingness to learn could make them a valuable asset in the long term. The training you provide will help them transition smoothly into their new IT roles.
