title: Revamping your engineering resume for a software career
---

In an era of growing demand for IT professionals, there's an opportunity for graduates of mechanical, electrical, and mechatronics engineering disciplines to pivot into this promising field. Your problem-solving skills, mathematical aptitude, and readiness to learn can prime you for a rewarding career in software engineering. However, the first hurdle you need to overcome is to reshape your resume to highlight these qualities effectively and catch the eye of hiring managers. Here's how you can accomplish that.

## Headline and objective

In this section of your resume, your intent to transition into software engineering needs to be succinctly expressed. The headline and objective should be clear, relevant, and engaging. Here's an example to guide you, but remember, this is just an example – your own headline and objective should be original and specifically tailored to reflect your experiences and aspirations:

**Original headline**: Mechatronics engineer with strong technical skills <br>
**Reworded headline**: Versatile mechatronics engineer with a keen interest in software development

In the reworded headline, the intent to transition into software development is made immediately clear, and the word "Versatile" suggests your adaptability – a critical trait for those switching industries.

**Original objective**: A dedicated and reliable engineering professional seeking opportunities to utilize my technical skills and contribute to a dynamic engineering team. <br>
**Reworded objective**: Aspiring to leverage my robust problem-solving abilities and computational skills, honed through a career in engineering, for innovative roles in the realm of software engineering. Eager to learn and grow, I am keen to join a company that encourages knowledge sharing and continuous development.

The reworded objective signals your intent to move into software engineering, underlining your commitment to learning and growth. It aligns you with companies that value these traits. 

It's crucial to note that these are examples and should not be copied verbatim. Your headline and objective should encapsulate your unique experience, goals, and personality. They are typically the first things hiring managers see, so ensure they are compelling and clearly communicate your career transition goals.

## Skills

To successfully pivot your career towards software engineering, it is essential to effectively highlight the skills you've acquired through your engineering studies and how they transfer into this new role. Here are five crucial abilities you should focus on, along with some tips on how to emphasize these skills effectively:

1. **Problem-solving**: Your engineering education has equipped you with strong problem-solving capabilities. Remember to emphasize this skill by citing instances from your past roles or academic projects where you had to devise solutions to complex problems.

2. **Mathematical aptitude**: A proficiency in mathematics forms the bedrock of software development. Ensure to highlight your mathematical expertise and provide examples of how these skills were applied in your engineering work or academic projects.

3. **Computer proficiency and familiarity with programming**: Exposure to computer science and coding, no matter how basic, can be a valuable asset when transitioning into software development. Be sure to detail your familiarity with any coding languages, software tools, or relevant courses you've undertaken.

4. **Desire to learn**: A key trait for those pivoting their careers is the eagerness to learn new skills. Display your commitment to continuous learning, especially in areas like IT and coding. Mention any additional certifications, online courses, or training you've undertaken, even if they're not directly related to programming.

5. **Interpersonal and communication skills**: Software development isn't done in isolation; it often involves collaboration with diverse teams. Hence, your ability to work well with others and communicate your ideas effectively is paramount. Validate these skills by referring to your involvement in team-based projects, leadership roles, or any other experience that required substantial interaction and collaboration.

By articulating these transferable skills and giving specific examples, you can create a compelling argument for your ability to transition smoothly into a software engineering role.

## Experience and Projects

Whether you are a fresh graduate or have practical experience, this section of your resume provides an opportunity to highlight your problem-solving abilities, mathematical application, exposure to programming, or direct experience with software development.

Focus on tasks or projects in your work experience that may be relevant to software engineering. It could be software or tools you've used, problems you've solved using computational methods, or situations where you've had to understand or use code. You may not have professional experience, but you can showcase relevant experience gained from your engineering degree.

For instance:

- "Used advanced diagnostic software tools to diagnose and rectify faults in mechanical systems, resulting in a 20% enhancement in system uptime."
- "Developed a software-based simulation in MATLAB to optimize the design of an HVAC system, achieving a 30% improvement in energy efficiency."
- "Employed PLC programming in the automation of an assembly line, enhancing overall production efficiency by 25%."
- "Used CAD software for designing and simulating complex electrical circuit designs, resulting in a 15% reduction in design errors."
- "Implemented a power system analysis using Python to improve grid reliability, resulting in a 20% decrease in power outages."
- "Developed an Arduino-based system, gaining familiarity with embedded system programming, a key skill in software development."
- "Created a home automation system with Raspberry Pi, improving skills in IoT programming, relevant for developing IoT software applications.

In each case, clearly mention the tools and technologies used, as well as any notable achievements or outcomes. Show how these experiences demonstrate your potential as a software engineer, emphasizing your problem-solving abilities, mathematical skills, and eagerness to learn. Your engineering background can offer a unique perspective to a future software engineering team.

## Education and training

Besides your core engineering degree, mention any courses related to computer science or programming you've completed. If you're planning on furthering your qualifications in these areas, include those plans as well. Joining boot camps is another excellent way to acquire necessary skills and gain hands-on experience in software engineering. Some worthwhile options include:
