title: Computer proficiency
---
Here are some specific elements a non-tech recruiter might look for in a mechanical engineering graduate's resume to evaluate their computer proficiency:

**1. Coursework:** Review their academic record for any classes related to computer science, programming, or data analysis. This could include courses like "Introduction to Programming," "Data Structures and Algorithms," or "Computational Methods in Engineering." They may have taken these as electives or as part of their core curriculum.

**2. Programming Languages:** Look for mentions of programming languages such as Python, C++, Java, MATLAB, or others. Even if they're not yet proficient, a basic understanding of any of these languages can be a positive sign.

**3. Software Proficiency:** Mechanical engineering students often become proficient in certain software tools as part of their studies. Look for software relevant to their discipline such as CAD (AutoCAD, SolidWorks) and simulation software (ANSYS, MATLAB), as well as general productivity tools (Microsoft Office, Google Suite).

**4. Projects:** Pay attention to any projects that involved a significant computing component. For example, did they use MATLAB to solve complex mathematical problems, Python for data analysis, or a CAD software to design a mechanical component?

**5. Certifications:** Have they obtained any certifications in computer-related skills? This could be anything from a Python course on Coursera, to a data analysis course on edX, or a CAD certification from an industry-recognized provider.

**6. Extracurricular Activities:** Membership in coding clubs, participation in hackathons, or contributions to open-source projects can also indicate computer proficiency.

> Remember, while basic computer skills are essential, the specific skills required will depend on the IT role they're transitioning into. If the role requires a particular programming language or tool, it's important to look for evidence of those specific skills. But even without that, a general aptitude for computing and evidence of self-directed learning can be a good sign that they'll be able to pick up the necessary skills during the training program.
