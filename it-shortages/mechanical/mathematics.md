title: Identifying math skills
---
Here's how you might look for signs of strong mathematical skills in the resume of a mechanical engineering graduate:

### Coursework:
Examine their academic coursework in the "Education" section of the resume for advanced mathematics classes such as Calculus, Differential Equations, or Linear Algebra. In the context of mechanical engineering, classes involving Fluid Mechanics, Thermodynamics, or Material Science might have required significant mathematical proficiency as well.

### Projects:
Look for projects that necessitated substantial mathematical analysis. For example, a mechanical engineering student might have designed a mechanical system such as a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system which would require knowledge of thermodynamics and heat transfer equations. Similarly, designing and analyzing structural elements might involve substantial mathematical calculations.

### Internships or Research:
Positions that required a high degree of quantitative analysis, like internships in product development, machine design, or systems optimization, might suggest strong mathematical abilities. Involvement in research projects, particularly those that required computational modeling or simulation, can also be a good sign.

### Competitions:
Participation in mechanical engineering competitions that involve design, analysis, or optimization could also indicate a solid mathematical foundation. Many of these competitions, like the Formula SAE or Solar Car Challenge, require participants to apply complex mathematical concepts to solve real-world engineering problems.

### Certifications or Additional Learning:
The candidate might have pursued additional learning opportunities in the field of mathematics or applied mathematics. This could include online courses or certifications on platforms like Coursera or edX, or even in-person workshops or seminars.

> In the end, while the resume can give you some insights, also consider asking problem-solving questions during the interview or as part of an assessment to better understand their mathematical reasoning abilities.
